# ML-Number-Predictor

This is a basic deep learning number predictor from a convolutional neural network trained with data from MNIST.

## Usage

To train the model, run `py train.py`.

To run predictions against the pre-trained model (or after training your own) run `py evaluate_number.py` in the same directory as `model.h5` and `model.json`. 

Running predictions against a trained model will show the image the model is shown as a popup, and the prediction in standard output.
